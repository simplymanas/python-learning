    """
    A string-based encoding of a particular chunking of a text.
    Internally, the ``ChunkString`` class uses a single string to
    encode the chunking of the input text.  This string contains a
    sequence of angle-bracket delimited tags, with chunking indicated
    by braces.  An example of this encoding is::

        {<DT><JJ><NN>}<VBN><IN>{<DT><NN>}<.>{<DT><NN>}<VBD><.>

    ``ChunkString`` are created from tagged texts (i.e., lists of
    ``tokens`` whose type is ``TaggedType``).  Initially, nothing is
    chunked.

    The chunking of a ``ChunkString`` can be modified with the ``xform()``
    method, which uses a regular expression to transform the string
    representation.  These transformations should only add and remove
    braces; they should *not* modify the sequence of angle-bracket
    delimited tags.

    Convert a tag pattern to a regular expression pattern.  A "tag
    pattern" is a modified version of a regular expression, designed
    for matching sequences of tags.  The differences between regular
    expression patterns and tag patterns are:

        - In tag patterns, ``'<'`` and ``'>'`` act as parentheses; so
          ``'<NN>+'`` matches one or more repetitions of ``'<NN>'``, not
          ``'<NN'`` followed by one or more repetitions of ``'>'``.
        - Whitespace in tag patterns is ignored.  So
          ``'<DT> | <NN>'`` is equivalant to ``'<DT>|<NN>'``
        - In tag patterns, ``'.'`` is equivalant to ``'[^{}<>]'``; so
          ``'<NN.*>'`` matches any single tag starting with ``'NN'``.

    In particular, ``tag_pattern2re_pattern`` performs the following
    transformations on the given pattern:

        - Replace '.' with '[^<>{}]'
        - Remove any whitespace
        - Add extra parens around '<' and '>', to make '<' and '>' act
          like parentheses.  E.g., so that in '<NN>+', the '+' has scope
          over the entire '<NN>'; and so that in '<NN|IN>', the '|' has
          scope over 'NN' and 'IN', but not '<' or '>'.

    A grammar based chunk parser.  ``chunk.RegexpParser`` uses a set of
    regular expression patterns to specify the behavior of the parser.
    The chunking of the text is encoded using a ``ChunkString``, and
    each rule acts by modifying the chunking in the ``ChunkString``.
    The rules are all implemented using regular expression matching
    and substitution.

    A grammar contains one or more clauses in the following form::

     NP:
       {<DT|JJ>}          # chunk determiners and adjectives
       }<[\.VI].*>+{      # chink any tag beginning with V, I, or .

                          # with one starting with a noun

    The patterns of a clause are executed in order.  An earlier
    pattern may introduce a chunk boundary that prevents a later
    pattern from executing.  Sometimes an individual pattern will
    match on multiple, overlapping extents of the input.  As with
    regular expression substitution more generally, the chunker will
    identify the first match possible, then continue looking for matches
    after this one has ended.

    The clauses of a grammar are also executed in order.  A cascaded
    chunk parser is one having more than one clause.  The maximum depth
    of a parse tree created by this chunk parser is the same as the
    number of clauses in the grammar.
