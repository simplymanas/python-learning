    """Return a synset for an ambiguous word in a context.

    :param iter context_sentence: The context sentence where the ambiguous word
         occurs, passed as an iterable of words.
    :param str ambiguous_word: The ambiguous word that requires WSD.
    :param str pos: A specified Part-of-Speech (POS).
    :param iter synsets: Possible synsets of the ambiguous word.
    :return: ``lesk_sense`` The Synset() object with the highest signature overlaps.

    This function is an implementation of the original Lesk algorithm (1986) [1].

    Usage example::

        >>> lesk(['I', 'went', 'to', 'the', 'bank', 'to', 'deposit', 'money', '.'], 'bank', 'n')
        Synset('savings_bank.n.02')
