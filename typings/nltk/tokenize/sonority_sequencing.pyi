The Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) is a language agnostic algorithm proposed
by Otto Jesperson in 1904. The sonorous quality of a phoneme is judged by the
openness of the lips. Syllable breaks occur before troughs in sonority. For more
on the SSP see Selkirk (1984).

The default implementation uses the English alphabet, but the `sonority_hiearchy`
can be modified to IPA or any other alphabet for the use-case. The SSP is a
universal syllabification algorithm, but that does not mean it performs equally
across languages. Bartlett et al. (2009) is a good benchmark for English accuracy
if utilizing IPA (pg. 311).

Importantly, if a custom hiearchy is supplied and vowels span across more than
one level, they should be given separately to the `vowels` class attribute.
