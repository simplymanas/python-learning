"""
Tools for graphically displaying and interacting with the objects and
processing classes defined by the Toolkit.  These tools are primarily
intended to help students visualize the objects that they create.

The graphical tools are typically built using "canvas widgets", each
of which encapsulates the graphical elements and bindings used to
display a complex object on a Tkinter ``Canvas``.  For example, NLTK
defines canvas widgets for displaying trees and directed graphs, as
well as a number of simpler widgets.  These canvas widgets make it
easier to build new graphical tools and demos.  See the class
documentation for ``CanvasWidget`` for more information.

The ``nltk.draw`` module defines the abstract ``CanvasWidget`` base
class, and a number of simple canvas widgets.  The remaining canvas
widgets are defined by submodules, such as ``nltk.draw.tree``.

The ``nltk.draw`` module also defines ``CanvasFrame``, which
encapsulates a ``Canvas`` and its scrollbars.  It uses a
``ScrollWatcherWidget`` to ensure that all canvas widgets contained on
its canvas are within the scroll region.

Acknowledgements: Many of the ideas behind the canvas widget system
are derived from ``CLIG``, a Tk-based grapher for linguistic data
structures.  For more information, see the CLIG
homepage (http://www.ags.uni-sb.de/~konrad/clig.html).

@add_metaclass(ABCMeta)
class CanvasWidget(object):
    """
    A collection of graphical elements and bindings used to display a
    complex object on a Tkinter ``Canvas``.  A canvas widget is
    responsible for managing the ``Canvas`` tags and callback bindings
    necessary to display and interact with the object.  Canvas widgets
    are often organized into hierarchies, where parent canvas widgets
    control aspects of their child widgets.

    Each canvas widget is bound to a single ``Canvas``.  This ``Canvas``
    is specified as the first argument to the ``CanvasWidget``'s
    constructor.

    Attributes.  Each canvas widget can support a variety of
    "attributes", which control how the canvas widget is displayed.
    Some typical examples attributes are ``color``, ``font``, and
    ``radius``.  Each attribute has a default value.  This default
    value can be overridden in the constructor, using keyword
    arguments of the form ``attribute=value``:

        >>> from nltk.draw.util import TextWidget
        >>> cn = TextWidget(c, 'test', color='red')

    Attribute values can also be changed after a canvas widget has
    been constructed, using the ``__setitem__`` operator:

        >>> cn['font'] = 'times'

    The current value of an attribute value can be queried using the
    ``__getitem__`` operator:

        >>> cn['color']
        red

    For a list of the attributes supported by a type of canvas widget,
    see its class documentation.

    Interaction.  The attribute ``'draggable'`` controls whether the
    user can drag a canvas widget around the canvas.  By default,
    canvas widgets are not draggable.

    ``CanvasWidget`` provides callback support for two types of user
    interaction: clicking and dragging.  The method ``bind_click``
    registers a callback function that is called whenever the canvas
    widget is clicked.  The method ``bind_drag`` registers a callback
    function that is called after the canvas widget is dragged.  If
    the user clicks or drags a canvas widget with no registered
    callback function, then the interaction event will propagate to
    its parent.  For each canvas widget, only one callback function
    may be registered for an interaction event.  Callback functions
    can be deregistered with the ``unbind_click`` and ``unbind_drag``
    methods.

    Subclassing.  ``CanvasWidget`` is an abstract class.  Subclasses
    are required to implement the following methods:

      - ``__init__``: Builds a new canvas widget.  It must perform the
        following three tasks (in order):
          - Create any new graphical elements.
          - Call ``_add_child_widget`` on each child widget.
          - Call the ``CanvasWidget`` constructor.
      - ``_tags``: Returns a list of the canvas tags for all graphical
        elements managed by this canvas widget, not including
        graphical elements managed by its child widgets.
      - ``_manage``: Arranges the child widgets of this canvas widget.
        This is typically only called when the canvas widget is
        created.
      - ``_update``: Update this canvas widget in response to a
        change in a single child.

    For a ``CanvasWidget`` with no child widgets, the default
    definitions for ``_manage`` and ``_update`` may be used.

    If a subclass defines any attributes, then it should implement
    ``__getitem__`` and ``__setitem__``.  If either of these methods is
    called with an unknown attribute, then they should propagate the
    request to ``CanvasWidget``.

    Most subclasses implement a number of additional methods that
    modify the ``CanvasWidget`` in some way.  These methods must call
    ``parent.update(self)`` after making any changes to the canvas
    widget's graphical elements.  The canvas widget must also call
    ``parent.update(self)`` after changing any attribute value that
    affects the shape or position of the canvas widget's graphical
    elements.
