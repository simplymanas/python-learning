"""
Interfaces for labeling tokens with category labels (or "class labels").

``ClassifierI`` is a standard interface for "single-category
classification", in which the set of categories is known, the number
of categories is finite, and each text belongs to exactly one
category.

``MultiClassifierI`` is a standard interface for "multi-category
classification", which is like single-category classification except
that each text belongs to zero or more categories.
