The PP attachment is to the verb phrase (V) or noun phrase (N), i.e.:

(VP gives (NP authority) (PP to administration))
(VP gives (NP inventors (PP of microchip)))

The corpus contains the following files:

training:   training set
devset:     development test set, used for algorithm development.
test:       test set, used to report results
