"""
Lexical translation model that ignores word order.

In IBM Model 1, word order is ignored for simplicity. As long as the
word alignments are equivalent, it doesn't matter where the word occurs
in the source or target sentence. Thus, the following three alignments
are equally likely.

Source: je mange du jambon
Target: i eat some ham
Alignment: (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3)

Source: je mange du jambon
Target: some ham eat i
Alignment: (0,2) (1,3) (2,1) (3,1)

Source: du jambon je mange
Target: eat i some ham
Alignment: (0,3) (1,2) (2,0) (3,1)

Note that an alignment is represented here as
(word_index_in_target, word_index_in_source).

The EM algorithm used in Model 1 is:
E step - In the training data, count how many times a source language
         word is translated into a target language word, weighted by
         the prior probability of the translation.

M step - Estimate the new probability of translation based on the
         counts from the Expectation step.


Notations:
i: Position in the source sentence
    Valid values are 0 (for NULL), 1, 2, ..., length of source sentence
j: Position in the target sentence
    Valid values are 1, 2, ..., length of target sentence
s: A word in the source language
t: A word in the target language
