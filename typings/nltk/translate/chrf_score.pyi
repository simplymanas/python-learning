    Calculates the sentence level CHRF (Character n-gram F-score) described in
     - Maja Popovic. 2015. CHRF: Character n-gram F-score for Automatic MT Evaluation.
       In Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Machine Translation.
       http://www.statmt.org/wmt15/pdf/WMT49.pdf
     - Maja Popovic. 2016. CHRF Deconstructed: Î² Parameters and n-gram Weights.
       In Proceedings of the 1st Conference on Machine Translation.
       http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/pdf/W16-2341.pdf

    This implementation of CHRF only supports a single reference at the moment.

    For details not reported in the paper, consult Maja Popovic's original
    implementation: https://github.com/m-popovic/chrF

    The code should output results equivalent to running CHRF++ with the
    following options: -nw 0 -b 3

    An example from the original BLEU paper
    http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P02-1040.pdf

        >>> ref1 = str('It is a guide to action that ensures that the military '
        ...            'will forever heed Party commands').split()
        >>> hyp1 = str('It is a guide to action which ensures that the military '
        ...            'always obeys the commands of the party').split()
        >>> hyp2 = str('It is to insure the troops forever hearing the activity '
        ...            'guidebook that party direct').split()
        >>> sentence_chrf(ref1, hyp1) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        0.6349...
        >>> sentence_chrf(ref1, hyp2) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        0.3330...

    The infamous "the the the ... " example

        >>> ref = 'the cat is on the mat'.split()
        >>> hyp = 'the the the the the the the'.split()
        >>> sentence_chrf(ref, hyp)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        0.1468...

    An example to show that this function allows users to use strings instead of
    tokens, i.e. list(str) as inputs.

        >>> ref1 = str('It is a guide to action that ensures that the military '
        ...            'will forever heed Party commands')
        >>> hyp1 = str('It is a guide to action which ensures that the military '
        ...            'always obeys the commands of the party')
        >>> sentence_chrf(ref1, hyp1) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        0.6349...
        >>> type(ref1) == type(hyp1) == str
        True
        >>> sentence_chrf(ref1.split(), hyp1.split()) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        0.6349...

    To skip the unigrams and only use 2- to 3-grams:

        >>> sentence_chrf(ref1, hyp1, min_len=2, max_len=3) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        0.6617...
