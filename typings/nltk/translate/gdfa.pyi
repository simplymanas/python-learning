    This module symmetrisatizes the source-to-target and target-to-source
    word alignment output and produces, aka. GDFA algorithm (Koehn, 2005).

    Step 1: Find the intersection of the bidirectional alignment.

    Step 2: Search for additional neighbor alignment points to be added, given
            these criteria: (i) neighbor alignments points are not in the
            intersection and (ii) neighbor alignments are in the union.

    Step 3: Add all other alignment points thats not in the intersection, not in
            the neighboring alignments that met the criteria but in the original
            foward/backward alignment outputs.
