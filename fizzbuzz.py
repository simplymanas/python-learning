# Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50.
# For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
# "Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division. Let's learn computers.
#
# You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
# "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
# "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
# "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
# The number as a string for other cases.
# Input: A number as an integer.
#
# Output: The answer as a string.
#
# for fizzbuzz in range(51):
#     if fizzbuzz % 3 == 0 and fizzbuzz % 5 == 0:
#         print("fizzbuzz")
#         continue
#     elif fizzbuzz % 3 == 0:
#         print("fizz")
#         continue
#     elif fizzbuzz % 5 == 0:
#         print("buzz")
#         continue
#     print(fizzbuzz)

    # It's using for auto-testing and must return a result for check.
